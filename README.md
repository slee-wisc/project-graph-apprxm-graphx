# project- ML based graph approximation in graphX

## Spark-GraphX Applications
The main applications are based on Spark framework and use GraphX
To run the applications written on scala scripts by using spark-submit, you need to create JAR package containing the applicationâ€™s code first.
(http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html#self-contained-applications)

1. Sample graph and run triangular count : project_main.scala
2. Sample graph and save the sampled graph : sample_graph.scala
For usage of each application, please refer to run_main.sh and run_sampling.sh, respectively.
